<br/>
<h2>Breaking Terms </h2>
<p>Breaking any of the terms in this agreement could result in a warning, account suspension, or account deletion at the discretion 
of Onionsquare.com administrators. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Fees </h2>
<p>There are no fees for registering an account or creating a store. Onion Square only takes fees from sellers when they make a sale.
 The fee is 8% of any revenue made using the Onionsquare.com website. This fee can be reduced by using the Invite Program, which is 
 explained bellow.
 </p>
<br/>
<h2>Payment Processing</h2>
<p>Processing fees for any form of payment (i.e. credit, debit, etc.) is the seller's responsibility at all times. Onion Square will 
not collect any processing fees on any sale and is not responsible for paying the fees for each transaction to the processing 
companies. Onion Square will not be held liable, legally or financially, for payment processing.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Invite Program for Sellers</h2>
<p>The Invite Program is a reward system for sellers who refer new sellers to Onionsquare.com to make an account and create a store 
of their own. When a seller signs up because you referred them you get Points for each sale they make. Points are Onion Square's 
virtual money, and 1 Point is equal to US$1. When a seller you referred makes a sale you get 0.5% of what they sold, but in Points 
rather than money. The points you earn will then be used to reduce the fee that you pay to Onion Square. Points work by covering a 
portion of the fee that you owe for a sale and can lower the fee to 2%, but no lower than that. Points never expire and always roll 
over every month.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Example of the Invite Program: </h3>
<p>Seller A (you) refers Seller B (your friend) to Onionsquare.com and they set up their own store. Seller B makes their first sale 
for $200 and Seller A gets 0.5% in Points. Now Seller A has $1 in Points that gets used towards their next sale. Seller A sells an 
item for $100. The normal fee of 8% would be $8, but the $1 in Points Seller A has reduces the fee to $7, bringing the fee down to 
7%. If Seller A had more points the fee could be reduced to $2 at the lowest.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>My Square Feature </h2>
<p>
	My Square is a networking feature of Onionsquare.com that allows sellers to add other Onion Square stores that they like to a 
	list that displays on their Home Page. This allows buyers and visitors to be able to look at the stores in your My Square just by 
	clicking a link. My Square is not part of the Invite Program, so no Points can be earned by a customer going to another store on 
	your My Square list.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Shipping and Returns</h2>
<p>
	Onion Square is not responsible for shipping or returns. Each store has its own policies for shipping and returns, and it is the 
	buyer's responsibility to check the policies of any seller they wish to buy from. Onion Square and Onionsquare.com holds no liability
	and is not legally responsible if a seller does not abide by their own policies.
 </p>
<br/>
<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p> sellers are responsible for both collecting and reporting any state or federal taxes. This includes sales, income, or any other 
taxes that apply to a seller's activity on Onionsquare.com. Sellers are also responsible for understanding federal tax laws and any 
state tax laws that they need to follow. Onion Square will not be held responsible for any issues any user may have with the IRS or 
any State Revenue Office, and Onion Square has no obligation to get involved with any case or investigation.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Inactive Accounts </h2>
<p>
	A seller's account is considered Inactive if no sales are made for 5 months. When this happens Onion Square will send a warning 
	message. If the account stays inactive for another month (6 months total) then Onion Square will close the account and remove the 
	store page.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Copyrights</h2>
<p>
	All Onion Square logos, content, pictures, videos, or any other media on Onionsquare.com are protected under copyrights. Unless 
	you have been given written permission to do so, using any Onion Square content for your own purposes in any way is illegal. The 
	content on a seller's store page belongs to the store owner and is also under copyright. To use their content you must get permission
	from the seller and not Onion Square.
 </p>
<br/>
<h2>External Links </h2>
<p> 
Onion Square and its users may post links to other websites for various reasons. Users who follow external links do so at their 
own risk and Onion Square is not liable for anything that happens as a result of following an external link. Onion Square does not 
necessarily endorse or agree with any views, opinions, or content posted on websites that links may lead a user to.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Release of Legal Liability </h2>
<p>
Onion Square is not liable for any disputes that happen between any users. Buyers purchase products at their own risk and Onion 
Square is not responsible for any monetary loss as a result of poor conduct by a seller. By agreeing to these Terms of Use you agree 
that you will not hold Onion Square liable for any issues, damages, or losses that result from using Onionsquare.com or our services. 
You will not initiate legal proceedings against Onion Square in the event of loss, injury, or dispute.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>If a dispute does happen between any users they must settle it on their own and Onion Square will not be expected to get involved 
in the process. Onion Square will not be expected to pay for any legal fees of any kind if a dispute between users results in legal 
proceedings. Although Onion Square will not be a witness in any legal proceedings we will provide any records we may have that can 
help resolve the issue. A user can't request the records of another user without verifiable permission, but if a subpoena or other 
legal document is issued for records Onion Square will comply.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>Onion Square does not sell advertising space on the website in any way. It is against the Terms of Use for any user to post their 
own ads anywhere on Onionsquare.com. If a user wishes to make ads that lead to Onionsquare.com or their own store page they can do so
 as long as they aren't violating any copyright laws.
 </p>
<br/> 
<h2>Complaints</h2>
<p>If a user is breaking these Terms of Use other users may report that user to Onion Square by sending us an email at 
complaints@onionsquare.com. If the complaint is verified Onion Square will take action to prevent the user from breaking the 
Terms of Use further. However, if a user is only sending spam to us or they send complaints to us and the other user isn't breaking 
any terms (used as a form of revenge) we may decide to take action against the user filing the complaint. Unless the user you are 
complaining about does something else please don't send another message to us about them. This will be considered spam and we may 
take action against you.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>User Content</h2>
<p>Although we will try as much as possible to regulate the content that users post on their pages and on other places at 
Onionsquare.com we are not able to monitor every piece of content our users post. Because of this Onion Square is not liable for any 
offensive, obscene, or abusive content that our users may post. When discovered, we will remove any material that can be considered 
offensive or obscene without gained the owner/user'Äôs approval.
